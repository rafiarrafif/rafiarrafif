**👋 Hello, I’m Rafi**

I’m a Data Science student at Universitas Sebelas Maret. I currently work as a freelancer, staying open to every opportunity that comes my way. I don’t aim to stand out through noise or flashiness but through honesty, persistence, and intention.

**🧭 What I Believe**

I believe technology should serve people, not impress them. It should clarify, not complicate. To build is to respond, to listen, and to make something useful out of thought and empathy.

**🛠️ A Project I’m Growing With**

One of my ongoing projects is Nounoz Zone, hosted at zone.nounoz.com. It’s an ambitious attempt to build an "otaku center" a unified space for anime communities. I’m working to bring together the essence of platforms like Reddit’s anime channels, Kusonime-style free streaming, data from JikanAPI, and even personalized profiles inspired by MyAnimeList. Rather than jumping between fragmented sites, I want fans to have everything in one place.
While it’s still under development, the journey has already taught me a great deal from technical challenges like handling scalability with ElysiaJS, to human challenges like making decisions with a team that thinks differently. The codebase is private, but collaboration is always welcome. You can reach out to me via email if you're interested.

**🎯 Long-Term Objective**

To create something that brings value to others even if it’s quiet, even if it’s small. As long as it’s real, and it helps, it’s worth building.
